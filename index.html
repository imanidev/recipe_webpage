                <ul>
                    <li>1 tablespoon (14g) zest (grated rind) of 1 lime</li>

                    <li>1 1/4 cups (397g) sweetened condensed milk</li>
                    <li>2/3 cup (152g) of lime juice, freshly squeezed</li>
                    <li>1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon lime oil (optional)</li>

            <section class="instructions">
                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Select a pie pan whose inside top dimension is at least 9", and whose height is at least 1 1/4".
                        Preheat the oven to
                        325°F.</li>
                    <li>Make the crust by stirring together all of the crust ingredients, mixing until thoroughly
                        combined.</li>
                    <li>Press the crumbs into the bottom and up the sides of the pie pan.
                    </li>
                    <li>Bake the pie crust for 15 minutes; it'll start to darken in color a bit. Remove it from the
                        oven, and place it on a rack
                        to cool while you make the filling.</li>
                    <li>Whisk the lime zest and egg yolks at high speed of an electric mixer for about 4 minutes. The
                        mixture will lighten in
                        color and thicken somewhat</li>
                    <li>Stir in the sweetened condensed milk, mixing till smooth. Beat at high speed for 3 minutes; the
                        filling will become
                        slightly thicker, and gain a bit of volume.</li>
                    <li>Add the lime juice, stirring just to combine. The mixture will thicken. Add lime oil to taste.
                    </li>
                    <li>Pour the mixture into the crust, and return the pie to the oven. Bake for about 25 minutes,
                        until it appears set around
                        the edges, though still a bit wobbly in the center. The center should read about 145°F.
                    </li>
                    <li>Remove the pie from the oven, and cool to room temperature. Refrigerate for several hours before
                        serving. Slice and
                        serve each piece with a lightly sweetened dollop of whipped cream, if desired.</li>
